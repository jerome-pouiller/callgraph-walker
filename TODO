 - Rerieve symbols _image_ram_start, _image_ram_end and __rom_region_start,
   __rom_region_end.
     - Verify where the symbols are located.
     - List functions located in RAM
     - List function located in RAM that depends on function in Flash
 - In callee, all_callee, add a mark if the function use a callback
 - Compute the worst stack depth
     - Identify recursve calls
     - Identify unbounded stack size
     - identify the indirect calls
 - Find a way for the users to inform the tool about the real functions behind
   the callbacks
 - Add a mode to generate the Cmakelist fragment to place function and its
   dependencyes in RAM
 - Track access to .ro_data, .data and .bss
     - .data may have pointer to .rodata, so flash acesses can be masked
 - Add support for x86_64, x86 and other architectures
