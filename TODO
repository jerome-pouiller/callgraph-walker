 - Add some class in the code:
    - symbols key is currently a tuple. It should be a real class (ie.
      SymId(name, addr)) with comparaison and stringify operators
    - Symbols should provide functions to get name with "[I,L,R]" (Indirect
      Loop, RAM) flags if required.
    - Indirect calls are currently a tuple. It should be class.
    - src_file should automatically remove the prefix when displayed
 - Retrieve symbols _image_ram_start, _image_ram_end and __rom_region_start,
   __rom_region_end.
     - Verify where the symbols are located.
     - List functions located in RAM
     - List function located in RAM that depends on function in Flash
 - In callee, all_callee, add a mark if the function use a callback
 - Compute the worst stack depth
     - Identify recursve calls
     - Identify unbounded stack size
     - identify the indirect calls
 - Find a way for the users to inform the tool about the real functions behind
   the callbacks
 - Add a mode to generate the Cmakelist fragment to place function and its
   dependencies in RAM
 - Track access to .ro_data, .data and .bss
     - .data may have pointer to .rodata, so flash acesses can be masked
 - Add support for x86_64, x86 and other architectures
