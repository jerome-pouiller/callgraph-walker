 - Improve the worst stack depth computation
     - Identify unbounded stack size
     - Identify the indirect calls
 - Find a way for the users to inform the tool about the real functions behind
   the callbacks
 - Add a mode to generate the Cmakelist fragment to place function and its
   dependencies in RAM
 - Track access to .ro_data, .data and .bss
     - .data may have pointer to .rodata, so flash acesses can be masked
